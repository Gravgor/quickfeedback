**[COMPANY NAME] is excited to announce the launch of QuickFeedback!**

Have you ever wondered what your website visitors really think? Most users won't take the time to contact you - they'll simply leave if something isn't working or doesn't meet their expectations.

QuickFeedback solves this problem with a beautiful, customizable feedback widget that:
- Takes just 2 minutes to install with a single line of code
- Matches your brand's look and feel
- Automatically captures valuable context (device, browser, location, time spent)
- Delivers insights through a powerful analytics dashboard

üîç What makes QuickFeedback different?
- Simplicity - No coding knowledge required
- Comprehensive data - Get the full picture of user experience
- Affordability - Free during our beta period
- Beautiful design - Non-intrusive yet effective

We built this because we faced the same challenges with our own websites - existing solutions were either too complex, too expensive, or both.

Try QuickFeedback today: [LINK]

Currently free during our beta period!

## Product Hunt Comment Responses

### Positive Feedback Response

Thank you so much for the kind words! We've put a lot of effort into making QuickFeedback both simple to use and powerful in the insights it provides. If you have any feature requests or suggestions, we'd love to hear them!

### Technical Question Response

Great question! QuickFeedback works with any website regardless of what technology it's built with. As long as you can add a script tag to your HTML, you're good to go. The widget is also optimized for mobile and loads asynchronously, so it won't impact your page load speed.

### Feature Request Response

That's a fantastic suggestion! We're actually planning to add [feature] in our next update. We're building our roadmap based on user feedback (eating our own dog food!), so this is super helpful. Would you be interested in beta testing this feature when it's ready?
