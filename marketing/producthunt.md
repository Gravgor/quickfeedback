## Why we built this
We built QuickFeedback because we wanted a simple way to collect feedback on our own websites. Existing solutions were either too complicated, too expensive, or both. We wanted something that we could install in minutes, that would look great on our sites, and that would give us the insights we needed without breaking the bank.
